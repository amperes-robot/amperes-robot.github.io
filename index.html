							<p>At the end of second year, UBC Engineering Physics
								students spend the summer participating in ENPH 253, where they
								build robots to compete against each other. This year's
								competition is called "Robot Pet Rescue!".</p>
							<p>
								<strong>When and Where:</strong> August 6, 2015 at UBC Hennings
								Building, Room 200
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong> Scenario:</strong> A fire has broken out at the SPCA
								and the animals are scrambling to find safe places to hide! Your
								robot must enter the building to rescue the trapped pets from
								their hiding spots before the building goes up in flames. A
								collapsed water tube serves as convenient zipline for escape, or
								you can race out the way you came.
							</p>
							<p>Below is the playing surface and its features.</p>
							<img class="img-responsive img-centered"
								src="img/portfolio/playing-field.png" alt="">
							<p>
								The robot must be able to navigate through an 8' by 8' course
								divided into an upper and lower surface connected by a ramp.
								There will be a 14" wide, 18" tall doorway 4.5' from the edge of
								the safe area. An electrical tape path will run from the start
								area to the beginning of the upper surface. The Path is not
								guaranteed to be straight at any point, and there is no minimum
								radius of curvature. There will be rescue beacons at each end of
								the upper surface. Rescue beacons are IR beacons that will emit
								a 10 kHz sine wave. Any strategy using the beacons as “remote
								controls” to communicate with the robot (other than beacon
								location) is not allowed. There will be 6 pets in total in the
								locations roughly marked in the diagram above. For complete
								rules, see <a

							<h2>Mechanical Design</h2>

							<figure>
								<img src="img\APMERESvsSW.jpg"
									alt="AMPERES vs SolidWorks Design"
									style="width: 750px; height: 350px;">
								<figcaption>AMPERES vs SolidWorks Design</figcaption>
							</figure>

							<p>Mechanical design was broken into three main
								sub-assemblies: the chassis, the side arm and the front arm.
								Each sub-assembly could be constructed separately and basic
								functionality could be tested.</p>

							<h3>Chassis</h3>

							<p>The chassis consisted of the main body of the robot, PCB
								storage space, the drive system, the front sled and front
								brackets for static pet pickup.</p>

							<p>The main body of the robot was constructed from aluminium
								sheet metal, bent into shape and reinforced with brackets and
								pop rivets. This provided a base for other parts and
								sub-assemblies to be bolted or pop riveted to and storage space
								for retrieved pets.</p>

							<p>The back section of the chassis was used for PCB storage.
								A top section was bolted on to provide stability and space for
								mounting the TINAH. Shelves were slid into slots at the back of
								the chassis and supported by tabs. These shelves housed the
								PCBs. The back section was covered with the AMPERES name plate
								for completeness and to ensure PCBs were contained within the
								robot.</p>

							<p>Two versions of the drive system were designed. The first
								used holes in the chassis and a supporting bracket for the motor
								and axel. A wheel encoder was integrated into the power
								transmission system via gear between the motor and axel. After
								construction, it was realized that a three gear power
								transmission system was difficult to properly align, and further
								proper alignment of holes in the chassis and supporting bracket
								was nearly impossible to achieve. A second version of the drive
								system was designed in which the drive system was a self
								supporting sub-assembly. The encoder and its gear were removed
								from the power transmission chain and separately meshed with the
								motor gear. Although we were reasonably confident this second
								design would be more reliable and easier to fabricate, due to
								the time constraints of the course and risks of unforeseen
								challenges when converting to the new drive system, the second
								design was never fabricated. The drive system was designed with
								a 3:1 gear ratio to ensure sufficient torque for climbing the
								ramp. The use of small wheels allowed for a much smaller gear
								ratio than was required by competing teams.</p>

							<p>
								<img src="img\sledSW.JPG" alt="Sled"
									style="width: 390px; height: 300px; PADDING-LEFT: 15px; PADDING-TOP: 30px; PADDING-BOTTOM: 25px;"
									align="right"> The front sled was fabricated from steel
								sheet metal so that it could be bent and spot welded. It
								included holes and mounts for tape following QRDs (not shown). A
								sled was chosen to simplify design and eliminate potential
								issues with castor or wheel mounting. The sled pivoted on a
								simple axel to allow its bottom to remain flush with the playing
								surface while the robot climbed the ramp. This kept the QRDs a
								consistent distance from the playing surface to reduce the
								occurrence of unexpected sensor readings due to changes in
								distance from the surface.
							</p>

							<p>
								<img src="img\frontBracket.jpg" alt="Front Brackets"
									style="width: 390px; height: 260px; PADDING-LEFT: 15px; PADDING-TOP: 40px; PADDING-BOTTOM: 15px;"
									align="right"> Brackets were mounted to the front of the
								chassis to allow static pickup of the first and fourth pets.
								These brackets consisted of an acrylic mounting bracket and a
								steel pickup bracket reinforced with rare earth magnets. The
								bracket on the right side of the robot also included a
								microswitch and a switch plate so the robot could determine when
								it had reached the box containing the sixth pet. The pet on the
								bracket would with the box, activating the switch, sending a
								signal to the TINAH when the robot was at the box.
							</p>

							<p>In the original design, bent steel rod 'antennae' were
								intended to be used to mount IR sensors for the IR following
								section of the course. Early in testing we realised these mounts
								were not stable enough to aim the highly direction sensitive IR
								sensors we were using. A ridged meccano structure was built to
								support the IR sensors with LED holders to aim the sensors
								through a drilled out hole in the meccano.</p>

							<h3>Side Arm</h3>

							<p>
								<object align="right" style="PADDING-LEFT: 15px;">
									<iframe width="350" height="290"
										src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5qx_Er6wR_E"> </iframe>
								</object>

								The base of the side arm was constructed from aluminum sheet
								metal. Its purpose was to allow the arm's pivot point to be at a
								height such that is could reach the surface-level and elevated
								pets from approximately the same distance. The arm itself
								consisted of two linkages that were out of plane. The first
								linkage was integrated into a large gear to allow a DC motor to
								rotate the arm through a 6.5:1 gear ratio and the second simply
								rotated and helped to support the arm. This allowed the arm to
								rotate approximately 180 degrees in one plane without
								interfering with itself. Arm linkage lengths were chosen such
								that then pickup surface remained horizontal throughout arm
								rotation. The linkages were waterjet cut polycarbonate. The end
								of the arm consisted of a housing for the ends of the linkages,
								a rare earth magnet reinforced steel L-bracket and an aluminum
								flap below it. The housing consisted of steel rods to attach the
								linkages, threaded on each end, and acrylic panels bolted to the
								steel rods. aluminum flap served two purposes: it triggered a
								microswitch so the robot would know when it had picked up a pet
								and it allowed for a wedge to remove the pet from the arm when
								safely above the chassis.
							</p>

							<h3>Front Arm</h3>

									<iframe width="350" height="290"
										src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z9zXxxFyGZ8"> </iframe>
								</object>
								The front arm was designed to collet pet six. The arm was 12.5"
								long so that it could reach down into the box. The arm was
								driven by a geared DC motor through a 5:1 gear ratio to ensure
								sufficient torque. The arm and its body were constructed from
								aluminum sheet metal and five large rare earth magnets were
								attached to the end of the arm. <br> <br> <br> <br>

							<h2>Electrical Design</h2>
              <p>Electrical parts were built to navigate through the obstace course, to sense when pets have been picked up, and to control the motors in AMPERES. All of the electrical circuits used  were manually soldered onto PCBs and are controlled by an ATMega128-based Wiring board called TINAH.</p>
							<h3>Navigation</h3>
              <p>AMPERES uses a combination of tape following and IR following to navigate through the course.</p>
              <p>Four QRD1114 phototransistors, which read reflectance values to detect the tape on the playing surface, were placed under the robot. Two are mounted on the front sled for tape following, and work in conjunction with wheel encoders to ensure efficient tape following. Two were on the sides to detect the orthogonal tapes used to detect pet positions. Below is the QRD sensor circuit schema.</p>
              <img class="img-responsive img-centered"
                src="img/portfolio/Circuit_QRD.png" alt="">
              <p>Two front-facing QSD124 IR photodiodes for detecting the 10kHz rescue beacon were be used to triangulate the distance and angle of the beacon. Below is the IR detection circuit schema.</p>
              <img class="img-responsive img-centered"
                src="img/portfolio/temp-Circuit-IR.png" alt="">
              <h3>Microswitches</h3>
              <p>A microswitch is attached to the actuator arm’s and is triggered when a pet is attached to it. This is used to determine whether the pet has been picked up and when it is removed by the shearing pole. The front of the robot also has a microswitch, which is triggered when the robot hits the box at the end of the course containing the last pet.</p>
              <h3>Motors</h3>
              <p>Two motors are used for driving, each powering one wheel using differential steering. The two arms used to lift up pets are also each powered by a motor. Every motor is connected to a motor output on TINAH via an external H-bridge with a comparator attached. Similarly, another H-bridge is used for actuating the arm for picking up pets. The H-Bridge design we used were designed by an ENPH 253 teaching assistant, Scott Lawson, and is shown below.</p>

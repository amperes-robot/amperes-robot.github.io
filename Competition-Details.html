							<p>At the end of second year, UBC Engineering Physics
								students spend the summer participating in ENPH 253, where they
								build robots to compete against each other. This year's
								competition is called "Robot Pet Rescue!".</p>
							<p>
								<strong>When and Where:</strong> August 6, 2015 at UBC Hennings
								Building, Room 200
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong> Scenario:</strong> A fire has broken out at the SPCA
								and the animals are scrambling to find safe places to hide! Your
								robot must enter the building to rescue the trapped pets from
								their hiding spots before the building goes up in flames. A
								collapsed water tube serves as convenient zipline for escape, or
								you can race out the way you came.
							</p>
							<p>
								Below is the playing surface and its features.

							<p>
								The robot must be able to navigate through an 8' by 8' course
								divided into an upper and lower surface connected by a ramp.
								There will be a 14" wide, 18" tall doorway 4.5' from the edge of
								the safe area. An electrical tape path will run from the start
								area to the beginning of the upper surface. The Path is not
								guaranteed to be straight at any point, and there is no minimum
								radius of curvature. There will be rescue beacons at each end of
								the upper surface. Rescue beacons are IR beacons that will emit
								a 10 kHz sine wave. Any strategy using the beacons as “remote
								controls” to communicate with the robot (other than beacon
								location) is not allowed. There will be 6 pets in total in the
								locations roughly marked in the diagram above. For complete
								rules, see
